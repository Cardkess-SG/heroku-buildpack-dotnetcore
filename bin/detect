error <<-EOF
	Application not supported by this buildpack!

	The ASP.NET Core buildpack is set on this application, but was
	unable to detect an ASP.NET Core codebase.

	An ASP.NET Core app requires ${required_files} file(s) at the root of
	the directory structure.

	If you are trying to deploy an ASP.NET Core application, ensure that ensure that these files
	(${PROJECT_NAME}.csproj, Startup.cs and Program.cs) are present at the top level directory. 
	
	This directory has the following files:
	$(ls -1p "$1")
	
	If you are trying to deploy an application written in another
	language, you need to change the list of buildpacks set on your
	Heroku app using the 'heroku buildpacks' command.

	For more information, refer to the following documentation:
